This is the GWT Exporter module courtesy of Timepedia.org.  This module
allows you to expose GWT classes, methods, and fields as Javascript
objects and takes care of marshalling GWT objects back and forth
between the Javascript interface and the GWT interface.

You can email to the mailing list gwt-exporter@googlecode.com as well.

Build files are in maven central repositories, or in the download
section of the web site.

There is some good wiki pages and articles in the web site and you
can take a look to our test cases to learn usage.

You can also read the Timepedia blog, http://timepedia.blogspot.com
for a discussion of how everything works.
